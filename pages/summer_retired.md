TSU has an established relationship with Jack Yates High School, a Houston Independent School District public high school partner.

TSU has established a relationship with Jack Yates High School (see attached commitment letter), which has a contiguous boundary with TSU. The intervention will establish relationships with high school students prior to their matriculation in TSU and will be a major recruiting tool for College of Science and Technology (COST). Every week a professor and a student from the proposed CREST center will spend 2 hours in classroom interaction with teachers and students at Yates. The objective is to present encouragement and enhancement of science and mathematics education to promising students. The following is a list of student training programs to be implemented.

*	College Faculty Support. Every week a professor from TSU will spend 2 hours in classroom interaction with teachers and students at Yates. The objective is to present encouragement and enhancement of science and mathematics education to promising students.

*	After School Program. The after school program will be implemented during the school year, which is intended to supplement and enhance the science, mathematics and technological literacy of students who are potential COST students from Yates and other local high schools. Since many of these students will enroll in TSU, this activity will inform them and make them comfortable about the study of STEM subjects. Students will be recruited from each level of the high school and encouraged to study STEM at TSU. This initiative will address 100 students, 25 from each grade level 9, 10, 11, and 12. Supplementary education in science and mathematics will be provided for two hours after school. This educational effort will not only enhance skills, it will be directed toward developing interest in the study of science and mathematics in COST.

*	The Early Bird Summer Program. This program is designed to recruit minority 9th graders (20 each year for 5 years) for early entrance into college at TSU. This program is designed for students during the summers between the 9th and 10th grades, the 10th and 11th grades, and the 11th and 12th grades. They will be eligible for admission to TSU with advanced standing for some courses and, more importantly, they will have personal experience with the STEM program at TSU.

*	National Conference on STEM Pedagogy. The proposed CREST center will hold national conferences on STEM pedagogy starting in the second year of the proposed project. The purpose is to open a discourse on issues involved in the methods of teaching quantitative science courses. In this regard, COST held the first such conference on March 25, 2011 to begin the dialog with local secondary school educators as its initial effort in this initiative.

*	Institutional Management and Evaluation. The educational program will be under the control of the Center’s administrative committee. Because of the amount of time that will be required to manage the proposed program, some committee members will have their fulltime teaching loads reduced by one-quarter to one-half. It is intended that the planning and evaluation of the project be conducted utilizing contemporary tools and methodologies, leading to, for example, an analysis of the strength, weakness, opportunity and threat (SWOT) parameters as they pertain to the establishment of operational objectives for the educational program.

In the proposal, we envision that a total of 9 graduate students per year and 6 undergraduate students per year will be recruited and supported by CRCN over five years. We have developed a highly structured plan for recruiting and mentoring students. One source of potential graduate students is the existing Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program at TSU, which has been quite successful and productive. The TSU President has made recruitment a high priority, through installing dedicated recruiters, in addition to the individual efforts that are made by faculty members.



To directly address this disparity, we will:

1. Recruit 4 rising senior high school students to work with the investigators for 10 week during the summer months.
2. Each student will conduct hands-on training in principles, instrumentation, and techniques and participate in laboratory meetings to formally/informally discuss research and current literature related to research topics.
3. Provide each high school student with career planning and guidance on how to apply to college and chose STEM fields. Each student will be required to prepare a written report at the end of the summer program detailing the research in which they have participated, and how the experience has affected their plans for the future.

With regards to our HS initiative, our RISE project will focus on positively influencing measurable academic outcomes at one local high school. The Jack Yates High School (HS) is physically adjacent to our TSU campus, and our program’s success there will be evaluated by a survey instrument that will gauge HS students’ attitudes towards STEM employment.
