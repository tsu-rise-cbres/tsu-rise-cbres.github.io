### Goals:
The main objective of the education program is to strengthen the graduate program in Environmental Toxicology at TSU. Towards this end, the main educational goals are: 

1.	establish a competitive graduate research fellowship, 
2.	improve existing curriculum to create a strong multidisciplinary foundation, 
3.	embrace the K-12 community and undergraduate students through
             summer internship programs to advance research-based learning experiences within 
             that population and motivate them to pursue advanced degrees in STEM fields,
4.	promote a professional academic  environment by organizing several grant writing workshop, seminar series and journal club, and conference and meetings participation.

Our funded RISE project will directly support both undergraduate (during the summer months) and graduate (PhD) students (throughout the academic year) at TSU.
