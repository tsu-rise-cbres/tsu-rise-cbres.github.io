**Mission**:

conduct basic science research that leads to improved understanding of the general biological principles guiding eukaryotic and prokaryotic cellular responses to environmental stress.

**Aims**:

1. Assess the exposure of the Houston population to platinum group elements discharged in automobile exhaust.

2. Build computer models able to predict the activities and pathways of specific stress-related molecules within exposed cells.

3. Strengthen the environmental toxicology PhD program, housed within the Department of Environmental and Interdisciplinary Sciences, by providing financial support to minority PhD students. A mentoring initiative for graduate students to support their course preparation, effective teaching and learning, grant writing, and research will be developed. One of the programâ€™s other major objectives is to embrace the K-12 community and undergraduate students through summer internship programs to advance research-based learning experiences and motivate them to pursue advanced degrees in STEM fields.
