Through basic science research, the _mission_ of this funded project is to improve our understanding of the general biological principles guiding eukaryotic and prokaryotic cellular responses to environmental stress. More specifically, the investigative team will assess the exposure of the Houston population to platinum group elements discharged in automobile exhaust. Computer models will also be developed to predict the activities and pathways of specific stress-related molecules within exposed cells. The NSF RISE award will strengthen the environmental toxicology PhD program, housed within the Department of Environmental and Interdisciplinary Sciences, by providing financial support to minority PhD students. A mentoring initiative for graduate students to support their course preparation, effective teaching and learning, grant writing, and research will be developed. One of the programâ€™s other major objectives is to embrace the K-12 community and undergraduate students through summer internship programs to advance research-based learning experiences and motivate them to pursue advanced degrees in STEM fields.
