### College Student Research Training:
Our funded RISE project will directly support both undergraduate (during the summer months) and graduate (PhD) students (throughout the academic year) at TSU. 

Undergraduates:

1.	Recruit 4 undergraduate students to work with the investigators for 10 week during summer months. 
2.	Each undergraduate student will conduct hands-on training in principles, instrumentation, and techniques and participate in laboratory meetings to formally/informally discuss research and current literature related to research topics.
3.	Provide each undergraduate student with career planning and guidance on how to apply to STEM graduate programs. Each student will be required to prepare a written report at the end of the summer program detailing the research in which they have participated, and how the experience has affected their plans for the future.
