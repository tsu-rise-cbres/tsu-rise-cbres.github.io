<h3>Goals:</h3>

<p>The goals of the education program in the funded RISE project all are designed to primarily strengthen the graduate program in Environmental Toxicology at TSU. More specifically, the main educational goals are: </p>

<ol>
<li> establish a competitive graduate research fellowship, </li>
<li> improve existing curriculum to create a strong multidisciplinary foundation, </li>
<li> embrace the K-12 community and undergraduate students through
         summer internship programs to advance research-based learning experiences within 
         that population and motivate them to pursue advanced degrees in STEM fields,</li>
<li> promote a professional academic  environment by organizing several grant writing workshop, seminar series and journal club, and conference and meetings participation.</li>
</ol>

<p>Our funded RISE project will directly support both undergraduate (during the summer months) and graduate (PhD) students (throughout the academic year) at TSU. </p>
