<h3>College Student Research Training:</h3>

<p>Our funded RISE project will directly support both undergraduate (during the summer months) and graduate (PhD) students (throughout the academic year) at TSU. </p>

<p>Undergraduates:</p>

<ol>
<li> Recruit 4 undergraduate students to work with the investigators for 10 week during summer months. </li>
<li> Each undergraduate student will conduct hands-on training in principles, instrumentation, and techniques and participate in laboratory meetings to formally/informally discuss research and current literature related to research topics.</li>
<li> Provide each undergraduate student with career planning and guidance on how to apply to STEM graduate programs. Each student will be required to prepare a written report at the end of the summer program detailing the research in which they have participated, and how the experience has affected their plans for the future.</li>
</ol>
