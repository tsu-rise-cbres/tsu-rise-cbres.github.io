<h3>PhD Environmental Toxicology Graduate Students:</h3>

<p>The Department of Environmental and Interdisciplinary Sciences, administered by Interim Chair Dr. Jason A. Rosenzweig,   houses both the Ph.D. and M.S. degree programs in Environmental Toxicology. This Ph.D. degree program, will be greatly strengthened by the RISE project in that 4 minority doctoral students will receive the Graduate Research Fellowship that consists of a generous stipend and tuition reimbursement. The selection process will take into account a personal interview, the grade point average and test scores. The winners of the fellowship will have the opportunity to work with one of the 4 RISE investigators on broad, multidisciplinary, cutting-edge projects. Through the monthly seminar program, students will interact with local leaders in the area of environmental toxicology and discuss job opportunities upon graduation.
Two graduate level courses in Modeling and Computer Simulations of Complex Systems, and Scientific Discovery enabled by Big Data will be offered as Environmental Toxicology Special Topics courses. The objective of these courses is to introduce and facilitate the use of supercomputing methods as effective tools in environmental toxicology research. Hands-on training on parallel computing will be offered through the High Performance Computing Center at TSU.</p>
