<h3>Outreach programs:</h3>

<p>The goals and objectives of our project’s outreach program will address issues associated with the underrepresentation of minorities in STEM careers by providing summer internship programs for high school and undergraduate students. We aspire to capture the interest and imagination of young, underrepresented students in STEM disciplines. Recently, the US House of Representatives recognized the College of Science and Technology STEM awareness forum for commitment and dedication to STEM education at TSU. At present, only 6% of all 24-year-old Americans hold an undergraduate degree in STEM disciplines. However, for African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans, the current STEM degree holding percentage is 2-3%, less than half than that of all Americans. In addition to ur educational efforts (read more below), our outreach efforts will include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Publication of research findings in peer reviewed journals Targeted including: Environmental Science &amp; Technology, Environmental Health Perspectives, Applied and Environmental Microbiology, etc.</li>
<li>Student and faculty presentations at regional and/or national conference.  Presentations will be made in scientific conferences such as: the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry Annual Meeting, American Society for Microbiology General Meeting, American Association for Cancer Research, Texas Academy of Science, etc.</li>
<li> Dissemination of research findings of this project, including (but not limited to) publications, technical reports, and community outreach material on this webiste.</li>
</ol>
